👋 Hello, I'm [Brian (brc0d3s)]!

🚀 Full-stack Developer | Django | React.js | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Firebase | Docker | AWS | Netlify | Railway

👨‍💻 I am passionate about crafting web applications that not only look great but also provide seamless user experiences. My tech stack includes Django for robust back-end development, React.js for dynamic front-end interfaces, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL for efficient data management.

🌐 I specialize in building RESTful APIs to connect front-end and back-end systems, ensuring smooth communication between different components of a web application. I believe in the power of clean, maintainable code and strive to implement best practices in all my projects.

🔧 In addition to databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, I've worked with Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication. Docker is my go-to for containerization, allowing for easy deployment and scalability.

☁️ I have hands-on experience with cloud services, particularly AWS, for hosting and managing scalable applications. Netlify is my choice for continuous deployment and hosting static assets, while Railway simplifies the deployment of databases and APIs.

🚢 Currently exploring serverless architecture and enjoying the simplicity and scalability it brings to web development.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out for collaboration, questions, or just to chat about tech. My virtual door is always open!
